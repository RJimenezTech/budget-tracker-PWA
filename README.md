[Budget Tracker Application](https://rjimenez-budget-tracker.herokuapp.com/)

From your browser, you should see a "download" or "install" icon in the browser task bar. Click that button and you will be prompted to install the progressive web application to you local machine or mobile device. Then, find the icon on Desktop or application list and select it. This will deploy the application locally.

## Usage

To use the application, enter a description and amount of the transaction, then select the "add" or "subtract" button. This will log the transaction on a graph, and the graph will update as you add more transactions. If you use the app when you are offline, the transactions will upload once you gain an internet connection.
